OMSCS: Machine Learning - Assignment 4 

The code in this project is remarkably unchanged from that which came from https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4

The code for this project is available at https://github.com/mcgarrah/cs7641-reinforcement-learning which includes this README file.

The JetBrains IntelliJ IDE was used with a Java 1.8 JDK installed on Windows 7 Professional.
Nothing in this code should require the IDE and could be executed from the Command Line.

Running the Grid World: Easy Version:

1. While inside the directory structure assignment4/src/burlap/assignment4/ right-click on the EasyGridWorldLauncher_JMM.
2. Go to the "Run As…" section and select "Java Application".
3. All three algorithms will run and the aggregate analysis and optimal policies will be printed to the console.
4. Additional popup visualizations will appear in order of VI, PI, and QLearn.

Running the Grid World: Complex Version:

1. While inside the directory structure assignment4/src/burlap/assignment4/ right-click on the HardGridWorldLauncher_JMM.
2. Go to the "Run As…" section and select "Java Application".
3. All three algorithms will run and the aggregate analysis and optimal policies will be printed to the console.
4. Additional popup visualizations will appear in order of VI, PI, and QLearn.

Running the Comparison code:

1. While inside the directory structure assignment4/src/burlap/assignment4/ right-click on the Learner_JMM.
2. Go to the "Run As…" section and select "Java Application".
3. The comparison code will create CSV files in the python directory.

Running the graph and diagrams code:

Install Python with NumPy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib
Install Microsoft Excel

1. Execute the figures.py file to create the image files in the figures directory
2. Load the Excel Spreadsheets that use the data from the first two Grid World executions.
